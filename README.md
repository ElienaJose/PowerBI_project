# PowerBI_project
Gained insights through visualizations in PowerBI about the average salary of various data professionals and their favourite programming language and job role using bar charts. Also gained insights on how difficult it was for them to break into data and how happy are they with their current role and work life balance with donut charts and gauges. Also the count of survey takers and their average age was displayed on cards. Tree maps are used to distinguish survey takers from different countries.
